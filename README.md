# Open API version of Spring PetClinic Sample Application 

This forks [spring-petclinic-rest](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest).


The primary reason for this fork is to add an [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification for the REST API and generate the Java REST server API using the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/).

It will take some of the changes from a [similar project](https://github.com/gantsign/spring-petclinic-openapi) but focus purely on the API. *There is no UI* above and beyond the Swagger UI.
